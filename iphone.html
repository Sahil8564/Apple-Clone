          November 25, 2022, to November 28, 2022, at a qualifying location.
          Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Customers shall
          receive a discount equal to the value of the Promotion Product
          (depending on their purchase) off the price of the Eligible Product,
          but will be charged for all items in their cart. Important notice
          regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple Card
          Monthly Installment (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: A purchase
          of an Eligible Product made when selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment
          option available only in the U.S.) as the payment type at checkout
          will receive an instant credit equal to the cost of the Promotion
          Product (Apple Gift Card) deducted from the price of the Eligible
          Product at the time of purchase. You will be charged one ACMI
          installment plan for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant
          credit. The value of the Promotion Product (i.e. the value of the
          Apple Gift Card) will also be charged in a separate second ACMI
          installment plan for the same number of months as the discounted
          Eligible Product. The total combined amount charged over the 2

          price of the Eligible Product. Separately, you will receive and be
